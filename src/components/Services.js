                    A properly designed and maintained roof should last 20 years or longer. The reality is that the average life of a new low sloped roof installation in the United States is less than 12 years!  Currently, in our country, there are literally hundreds of different roofing products, systems, manufacturers, etc. Each one claiming to be the best. It has been proven time and time again
                    that you must have the unbiased, professional representation of a roofing consultant to effectively manage your roofing dollars.
